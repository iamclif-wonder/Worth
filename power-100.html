For all his travels, he became a Washington animal, working at old-boy consulting firm Kissinger Associates and in the Clinton Treasury under Bob Rubin and Larry Summers. In October 2003, he was named president of thryruggled to find a voice-and a persona-that the public appreciates.

					<p><strong>Path to Power:</strong> Over the summer, Republican congressional leader John Boehner called on the president to fire Geithner. Geithner fought back, telling PBS' NewsHour that GOP partisanship was undercutting efforts to improve the economy. "That's not a political statement-that's reality,"  Geithner said.</p>
